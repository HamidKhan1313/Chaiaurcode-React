important point :- reconcilation is the algorithm behind what is popularity understood as the " virtual dom"

for interview prespective :- Diffing of list is perform using keys. Keys should be stable predective and unique

in link above mention :-

key points are important to understand
structure of fibre :-

It is understand when we complete react
Reconsiliation :-

Its a recursive agorithm which reconsider the react elements which can be changed or updated.
The algorithm React use to diff one tree with another to determine which part to need to be change.
In react there are two differentiation trees one is actual browser tree that is Dom and other is react tree that come from create root.
Update :- A change in data use to render app. Usually the result of set state result in re-render
